<h3>The Beatles' <i>The White Album</i></h3>

        <p> // all information was found on the wiki for the white album by the beatles
            This album was The Beatles ninth album, written and released in 1968.
            The self titled album is often referred to as <i>The White Album</i> because the cover is entirely white aside from the name. 
            This was done to seperate itself from previous album covers like <i>Sgt. Pepper's Loney Hearts Club Band</i> which were often full of detail and color. 
            It is one of the most famous albums in rock and music history and is often known as one of the greatest albums in history. 
            While one of their most famous, this album was full of drastically different song tones, since John Lennon wanted to write about falling in love with
            his new wife Yoko Ono, and Paul wanted to focus on real world issues, like the rising political conflicts.
            Ringo Starr even quit the band for a few weeks durring the creation of this album. Some of the tension could be due to
            this being the bands first album since the death of their manager, Brian Epstein.
            Some of the most notable songs are, "While my Guitar Gently Weeps", "Blackbird", and "Glass Onion"
