                                    In this project we made a website! We discovered how to add links to internal sections of the website, and 
                                    to other pages outside of the website completely. We also learned how to change 
                                    aspects about the websites colors and image resizing.
                                </p>

                                    In this project we learned more about how to make the pages prettier. Adding different color backgrounds,
                                    text, or adding borders. One thing in particular we learned was how to utilize padding, and changing margins.

                                    For this Assignment we figured out how to change various aspects of the website to make it 
                                    more professional looking, and easier to read the information. This assignment taught us 
                                    how to change the view of the website depending on the size of the screen.

                                    For this Assignment we copied a page from USC's website. We recreated this page down to every aspect
                                    of it to practice being able to understand how to make CSS pages.

                                    For this Assignment we copied a page layout that was given to us and we learned how to add animation and use sliders!
                                    We also practiced new skills such as changing an image when clicking on it, and hiding images until clicked on
                                    in certain areas.

                                    Added color and text to the project based on the draft from part 3. I added images for the pins,
                                    and picked out a cute color scheme for my website!
