                                    In this project we made a website! We discovered how to add links to internal sections of the website, and 
                                    to other pages outside of the website completely. We also learned how to change 
                                    aspects about the websites colors and image resizing.
                                </p>

                                    In this project we learned more about how to make the pages prettier. Adding different color backgrounds,
                                    text, or adding borders. One thing in particular we learned was how to utilize padding, and changing margins.

                                    For this Assignment we figured out how to change various aspects of the website to make it 
                                    more professional looking, and easier to read the information. This assignment taught us 
                                    how to change the view of the website depending on the size of the screen.

                                    For this Assignment we copied a page from USC's website. We recreated this page down to every aspect
                                    of it to practice being able to understand how to make CSS pages.

                                    For this Assignment we copied a page layout that was given to us and we learned how to add animation and use sliders!
                                    We also practiced new skills such as changing an image when clicking on it, and hiding images until clicked on
                                    in certain areas.

                                    For this Assignment we copied a page layout that helped us practice how to do more advanced

                                    and we learned how to do more conditional statements with animation.

                                    Created a website using arrays, attributes, and classes! Using JS files we were able to display attributes and 
                                    an ad banner that changes messages every 2 seconds. This excersize showed how not everything needs to be in the 
                                    HTML file and how it can make things more efficient to use classes and attributes.

                                    We learned how to use classes to get data in json files to be pulled up onto the website with js files. 
                                    This helped teach us that it is important to keep data stored in an easy location that will not get errors 
                                    from additional code.

                                    We learned how to use classes and other file types to design and pull data from JSON files.
                                    This was specifically surrounding images of a floor plans with other information about them being displayed too!

                                    We learned how to use render and node to create a live demo for our websites. We connected our github
                                    repos to the render account and were able to see how you can use those together to create a website.
